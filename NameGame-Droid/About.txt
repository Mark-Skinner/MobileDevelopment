This project is an attempt to create a simple game to help learn the names of your colleagues.
Unfortunately, Mark isn't very good at creating pretty user interfaces, so it isn't that great.
On top of that, Mark's computer is pretty bad so debugging with an emulator took ages.

With his minimal experience with Android programming, Mark did his best to create an awesome application.
Did he manage to pull it off? Of course not, this application looks atrocious. Luckily, Mark was happy
that he could start learning how to use Xamarin to develop Android mobile applications. He is
excited to continue expanding his knowledge in mobile development, even if it isn't necessarily with WillowTree.

Hope you enjoy the app!
