# Mobile Development: C# / Xamarin

This is the start of something great. Currently, it's not that great and the core concepts aren't there, but that's what makes it fun! Over time, I'm hoping to learn the key concepts and conventions for mobile development, particularly related to MVVM.

I will be adding to this repo as I create a few mobile applications with Xamarin. I hope to deploy them to Android and iOS devices when I have a better grasp on code architecture for mobile applications.
